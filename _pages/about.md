🏫 I'm a Junior at Lafayette College Studying Integrative Engineering with a robotics focus.
Integrative Engineering is an interdisciplinary program that combines mechanical electrical and computer engineering. It takes a systems-level approach to solving engineering problems.

🔬 Last summer I was an aerospace engineering intern at Piasecki Aircraft Corporation. Before that, I spent time as a research intern at the University of Pennsylvania's Rehabilitation Robotics Lab
